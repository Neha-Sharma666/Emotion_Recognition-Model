🚀 Harnessing the Power of AI to Understand Human Emotions in Hindi Text
<img src="https://github.com/Neha-Sharma666/Emotion_Recognition-Model/blob/main/web1.jpg.png">

Overview:
BHAAV AI  is an advanced emotion classification system built using IndicBERT and a custom MLP classifier to analyze and predict emotions from regional language text,Hindi in this case. The model is designed to capture the nuances of sentiment, enabling AI-driven applications that can understand human emotions effectively.

🚀 Key Highlights:
✔️ Deep Learning-Based: Uses IndicBERT embeddings and an MLP classifier for high-accuracy predictions.
✔️ Multilingual Ready: Built on IndicBERT, making it adaptable to multiple Indian languages.
✔️ Optimized Performance: Fine-tuned with efficient training techniques for robust classification. 

#📌 Technologies Used
🔹 Programming Language: Python 
🔹 Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch 
🔹 Pretrained Model: IndicBERT (from Hugging Face) 
🔹 Classifier: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
🔹 Tokenizer: Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer
🔹 Libraries: Transformers, Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib

#📌 Model and Approach
->IndicBERT for Feature Extraction:
  IndicBERT is a pre-trained transformer model optimized for multiple Indian languages, including Hindi. Instead of training a model from scratch, we leverage its power to generate high-quality sentence embeddings.

->Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier
  The MLP model acts as the classifier in BHAAV AI  

⚡ Future Enhancements
✅ Extend support for more Indian languages.
✅ Fine-tune IndicBERT further for better domain-specific accuracy.
✅ Deploy as a REST API for real-world applications.
✅ Enhance model robustness with data augmentation.
