#**Overview:**
BHAAV AI  is an advanced emotion classification system built using IndicBERT and a custom MLP classifier to analyze and predict emotions from regional language text,Hindi in this case. The model is designed to capture the nuances of sentiment, enabling AI-driven applications that can understand human emotions effectively.

**🚀 Key Highlights:**
✔️ Deep Learning-Based: Uses IndicBERT embeddings and an MLP classifier for high-accuracy predictions.<br>
✔️ Multilingual Ready: Built on IndicBERT, making it adaptable to multiple Indian languages.<br>
✔️ Optimized Performance: Fine-tuned with efficient training techniques for robust classification.<br> 

#**📌 Technologies Used**
⏺️Programming Language: Python<br>
⏺️Deep Learning Framework: PyTorch<br> 
⏺️Pretrained Model: IndicBERT (from Hugging Face)<br> 
⏺️Classifier: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)<br>
⏺️Tokenizer: Hugging Face's AutoTokenizer<br>
⏺️Libraries: Transformers, Sklearn, Pandas, Matplotlib<br>

#**📌 Model and Approach**
->IndicBERT for Feature Extraction:
  IndicBERT is a pre-trained transformer model optimized for multiple Indian languages, including Hindi. Instead of training a model from scratch, we leverage its power to generate high-quality sentence embeddings.

->Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Classifier
  The MLP model acts as the classifier in BHAAV AI  

#**⚡ Future Enhancements**
✅ Extend support for more Indian languages.<br>
✅ Fine-tune IndicBERT further for better domain-specific accuracy.<br>
✅ Deploy as a REST API for real-world applications.<br>
✅ Enhance model robustness with data augmentation.<br>
